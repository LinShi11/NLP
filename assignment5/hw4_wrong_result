Tweet: @ALL #Not #Long To Go #Before #MainStream #Media #Pitch. #Surgery #follows #with #me #using #Prototype #demonstrating #real #situation.Phil
Classification:
SYSTEM:
The tweet includes the hashtags #Not and #Before, which, when read together, may indicate irony. However, without additional context, it's challenging to determine the intended tone with certainty. The use of hashtags might suggest a playful or sarcastic tone. Therefore, the classification is Possibly ironic due to the ambiguity of the tweet's tone.

Tweet: The girls on #SororitySisters thought they'd get rich and famous but instead they be like... http://t.co/yGnRtq0tVy
Classification:
SYSTEM:
The tweet contains elements of irony. The phrase "they'd get rich and famous but instead they be like..." suggests a contrast between the expected outcome (getting rich and famous) and the actual situation ("they be like..."). The use of "be like" typically implies a reaction that is different or unexpected, adding a layer of irony to the statement. Therefore, the classification is Ironic.
