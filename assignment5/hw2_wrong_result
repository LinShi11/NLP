review: Me and my fiance recently stayed at the Trump Plaza. it was our first time to AC together and i must say it was a blast. They gave us some great Casino starters, getting 20 tier points get a free 25 dollars. Were not even big gamblers but said what the hell. We ended up winning 250 dollars in slots. It was a blast. Our hotel view was great, we stayed in one night, rented a movie, and order some room service. Even the food was great ( over priced, but all hotels are). Well worth it, Inexpensive and enjoyable
